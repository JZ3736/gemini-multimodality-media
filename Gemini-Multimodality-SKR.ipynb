      "**00:17 - 00:18:**  This is a good spot for ads because it is during a replay of a key moment (Von Grisson's catch). Viewers are likely to be engaged and willing to watch a short ad before moving on to the next play.\n",
      "\n",
      "**01:04 - 01:05:** This is another opportunity during a replay of an exciting play (the steal by Riley Greene).  The brief pause before the replay is ideal for a seamless ad transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "**01:24 - 01:25:**  This is a good spot for ads, as it occurs during a pitching change.  Viewers typically use this time to catch their breath and will likely be receptive to a brief ad break.\n",
      "\n",
      "**01:49 - 01:50:** This is a good ad placement due to a replay review for a close play. Viewers are likely to be engrossed in the replay, making it an opportune moment for a short ad break.\n",
      "\n",
      "**02:25 - 02:26:** This is an excellent ad opportunity during a pitching change that follows a noteworthy play (Rafael Devers' near-miss catch).\n",
      "\n",
      "**02:55 - 02:56:**  Viewers are likely to be captivated by the action as the Red Sox get runners on 1st and 2nd with 2 outs. This is a prime spot for a short ad break.\n",
      "\n",
      "**03:05 - 03:06:**  Following an exciting play (Ceddanne Rafaela's strikeout), this is a good moment to place an ad.  Viewers may want to refocus before the next play begins.\n",
      "\n",
      "**03:54 - 03:55:**  This is a good opportunity for ads as it occurs during a pitching change. It is a natural pause in the action and will not disrupt the flow of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "**05:45 - 05:46:** This is a great spot for ads, as it follows an exciting play (a broken bat and a close play at 3rd). Viewers will be engaged and receptive to a short ad break.\n",
      "\n",
      "**06:54 - 06:55:**  This is a good ad opportunity during a replay review of a close play, similar to the opportunity at 1:49.\n",
      "\n",
      "**07:44 - 07:45:** This is a good placement for ads, as it occurs after a key play (Tanner Houk's strong performance) and before the next inning begins.\n",
      "\n",
      "**08:00 - 08:01:**  Following a replay of a key moment (Colt Keith's 2-run home run), viewers are likely to be engaged and ready for a brief ad break before moving onto the next play.\n",
